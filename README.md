# 🌳 Decision Trees & Random Forests on Heart Disease Dataset

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of **tree-based models** — Decision Trees and Random Forests — applied to a classification problem. The focus is on **training, tuning, evaluating, and interpreting** models for predictive performance.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **File Used**: `heart.csv` (Heart Disease Dataset)  
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Heart Disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease) or equivalent cleaned dataset.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To learn and apply tree-based models for classification by:
- Training and visualizing a Decision Tree
- Controlling overfitting through depth tuning
- Building and evaluating a Random Forest
- Understanding **feature importance**
- Validating results with cross-validation

---

## 📌 Key Insights & Steps

- **Decision Tree** trained and visualized using Graphviz/Matplotlib.
- **Overfitting analysis** by comparing training vs. testing accuracy across different tree depths.
- **Random Forest** trained and compared against Decision Tree accuracy.
- **Feature importance** calculated to identify the most predictive features.
- **Cross-validation** performed to evaluate model stability.
